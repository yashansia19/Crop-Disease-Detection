Crop Health and Vegetation Check Using Satellite Image Classification

This project focuses on identifying crop health and vegetation condition using satellite images. It uses deep learning and image analysis to classify regions based on vegetation status. The goal is to support sustainable agriculture and land monitoring through early detection of plant stress and vegetation patterns.

Overview

The system analyzes satellite images to identify healthy and stressed vegetation. It processes satellite data, extracts vegetation related features, trains a deep learning model and produces classification results. The project helps understand plant health distribution across agricultural land.

Methodology

Data was collected from public satellite sources such as Sentinel and Landsat. Images were pre processed by resizing, filtering and removing noise. Vegetation indices such as NDVI were calculated. A convolutional neural network model was trained on labeled vegetation classes. The model was evaluated based on accuracy and prediction consistency.

Results

The model showed strong accuracy in detecting vegetation health levels. It correctly classified healthy and stressed regions in satellite images. Visual outputs helped understand the health variation across fields.

Tools and Technologies

Python
Deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow or Pytorch
OpenCV and NumPy for image processing
Matplotlib for visualization

Future Scope

Integration with real time satellite data
Deployment as a web dashboard for farmers and agricultural teams
Expansion to multi crop and disease classification
Use of transformer based remote sensing models for higher precision

Research Context

This project was developed as part of academic work focusing on artificial intelligence in agriculture. It demonstrates the use of satellite imagery and deep learning for vegetation health analysis and has potential for research extension and real world deployment.
